    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

On the other hand, when it comes to the LSTAT and PTRATIO features, an increase of them will mean a lower price. Obviously, those neighborhoods which a larger population of people working poor, have usually lower prices. In addition, schools that have a high ratio of students to teachers are less valued by families looking for a good education for there children, hence, it’s harder to sell houses around those schools lowering their prices.**"

    "The training score decreases as more points are added, which means that the training error is increasing. \n",
    "The testing score increases as more points are provided, which means that the testing error is decreasing as our model keeps improving and fitting better to out data.\n",

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "The model trained with a maximum depth of 1, It’s suffering from high bias. The model is not complex enough, so the error of the training and testing sets are always high, which means that our model doesn’t fit well our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of depth 10, we can see that the model is suffering from high variance, a sign of overfitting. The score of the training set is the highest in the curve, which means that the model is behaving well on the training set, but, in the case of the testing set, the score is the lowest in the curve. That indicates our model is not generalizing properly when we introduce new data because it’s too complex to our data."

    "\n",
    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "Please note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn versions 0.17 and 0.18.\n",

    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",

    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",

    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
